# Retro-investigation

This is a repo to test the hypotesis - it is possible to retro-actively boost contributor activity, as visible in github UI

Approach:

1. create a repo, commit with date in the past
2. use a script to create a flow of small commits with incremented dates
3. push resulting repo
4. See stats
